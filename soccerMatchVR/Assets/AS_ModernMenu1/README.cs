/*THANK YOU FOR DOWNLOADING THE MODERN UI MENU PROJECT!

If you want to learn how to make this project from scratch, I have a YouTube tutorial series 
that walks you through every step. This version has been converted to C# but the YouTube 
version was written in JavaScript since it was a while ago. The base scripts are all there
and you can customize them as you wish. This project is free to use and I hope to see some
cool variations of it in the future!

IMPORTANT NOTES: 

- There are PlayerPref values being saved to store data. That way, when you 
load up the project, the previous values for sliders are saved!

- The objects that have scripts on them are "Camera" "SFXSliderSound" and "Canv_Options"
    Other than that, no other objects have any scripts on them.


If you have any suggestions for how I can make these better, or a specific type of menu
that you would like to see, please email me! andrei@shulgach.com

Enjoy!
